# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is designed for two players to play on the same device.

## How to Play
1. Start the game.
2. Player 1 is X and Player 2 is O.
3. Players take turns clicking on a cell of the game board to place their marker.
4. The first player to get three of their markers in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
5. If all cells on the game board are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
